For the constant block :
we add a constant block with any value I want to generate a constant signal(inputs) and using it in any operations,eg.(sum, product,subtract,...).

For the display block :
by adding the display block we can visualise and see the result by displaying the signal I  was entered.


For the sum block :
the sum block is used to add or subtract the signal inputs(we can specify the number of signals we want to sum).

For the product block :
as we entered the product block, we can multiply the input signals together (we can specify the number of inputs we want to multiply)


For the gain block :
the gain block is similar to the product block but it's value is constant, so by using the gain block we can multiply the input signals by a constant factor.
